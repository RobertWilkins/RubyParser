I have developed the following software projects (not an exhaustive list)

1. Vilno Data Transformation
Since 2007, available under the terms of: GNU General Public License version 2
At the time, I read and evaluated this license.
Vilno Data Transformation was sometimes referred to as simply 
"Vilno" or "Data Crunch", in the years before Vilno Table was developed

2. Vilno Table
This product is not available under any open source license. Vilno Table and 
Vilno Data Transformation are two distinct software products. Since Vilno Table
is not an open source project, the source code is not posted on my GitHub 
account. Vilno Table can be configured to inter-operate with a data 
transformation engine other than VDT, if desired (such as an SQL database).

3. Some Date and Time code, written in C++
This is a very small source code base, needs to be finished , and for a very 
specific purpose: to manage dates and times that may have partially missing 
data or erroneous entries (like February 31, 2018). The standard libraries in 
C and C++ do not deal well with DIRTY date/time data, hence this code.
I uploaded an unfinished version of this code to my GitHub account in 
August/September 2019.
I haven't chosen a license yet. I intend to release this code under some
BSD/MIT style license (when I have had time to evaluate the text in such 
licenses) , or I will release this code under both a BSD/MIT license and the
GNU General Public License version 2


4. Ruby parser
I am uploading this Ruby parser to my GitHub account as of December 2019.
I am making this software available under the terms of:
GNU General Public License version 2
(the same open source license under which I released Vilno Data Transformation
 back in 2007)
After I have had time to evaluate the range of available MIT/BSD style licenses
, I intend to also release the Ruby parser under one of those licenses.
